## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Forest Green (#2E8B57) for accents and buttons to evoke a natural, grounded mood. This color is best suited for bold styling because of its higher saturation, and should provide good contrast against lighter colors.
- Background color: Misty Blue-Gray (#83A1CD) for backgrounds and panels to simulate a misty morning. Its relatively low saturation and brightness makes it ideal as the foundation of a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Warm Wood/Stone (#8B4513) for text and secondary accents to enhance the earthy feel and complement the green hues. Its low saturation and darker color contrast against the lighter blues.
- Headings: 'Playfair Display' (serif) for an elegant, high-contrast look in titles and key messages.
- Body Text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to be exceptionally readable on all screen sizes, ensuring a comfortable user experience for detailed descriptions and information.
- Minimalist, image-driven layout with generous use of white space, focusing on beautiful imagery and compelling content, with clear and intuitive navigation.
- Use icons alongside descriptions for amenities like Free WiFi, On-site Parking, etc., to make the information easily scannable.
